# Thus far, we've used iterators often. You've seen the use of #each and #map used on various data structures, such as Arrays and Hashes. 
# These methods make writing certain code a bit easier, at least when compared to a while or for loop. 
# Yet, what we've seen thus far is only part of what is available.

# Whenever we use map or each on something like an Array, we're using something called "Internal Iteration". 
# It's called that because the process and implementation of that iteration is hidden from us, 
# and the process that allows us to progress through a collection is part of that hidden implementation.

# There's also "External Iteration". This is iteration that takes place at the behest of the user. 
# Ruby gives us the option to use this type of iteration with the Enumerator class. For this exercise, lets take a bit of a tour of the capabilities of Enumerator. 
# While we do that, let's make something interesting with it.

# In this exercise, your task is to create a new Enumerator object. When creating a new Enumerator, you may define what values are iterated upon. 
# We'll want to create an Enumerator that can iterate over an infinite list of factorials. 
# Once you make this new Enumerator, test it out by printing out the first 7 factorial values, starting with zero factorial.

# More specifically, print the first 7 factorials by using an "External Iterator". 
# Once you have done so, see what happens if you print 3 more factorials (the results won't be correct). 
# Now, reset your Enumerator (use the rewind method). Finally, print 7 more factorials.

# You can find almost everything you need for this exercise in the documentation for Enumerator. 
# In particular, check out the ::new method; it should prove a good starting point for this exercise. 
# Some further details about internal vs external iterators are mentioned at the start of that documentation, so make sure to read that section. 
# That section is a bit dense at places; if you don't understand everything about it, that's ok.

# A factorial is a mathematical operation that involves multiplying a bunch of sequential positive numbers together. 
# They are usually written as a non-negative integer followed by an exclamation point, e.g., 4!. The values look like this:
# n 	n! 	notes
# 0 	1 	By definition, 0! is 1
# 1 	1 	By definition, 1! is 1
# 2 	2 	2! = 2 * 1
# 3 	6 	3! = 3 * 2 * 1
# 4 	24 	4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
# 5 	120 	5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1

# The factorial values (0!, 1!, 2!, etc.) follow a simple pattern. First, 0! and 1! are both defined to be 1. 
# All subsequent factorials are the result of multiplying all the integers from 1 up to the n value together. Thus, 5! is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1, or 120.

# The wikipedia page on factorials may also be of some use.

# Two final hints:

#     You'll only need 3 Enumerator methods to complete this exercise.
#     An Enumerator also implements the Enumerable module. Keep this in mind, as it may make certain parts of this exercise easier to write.
