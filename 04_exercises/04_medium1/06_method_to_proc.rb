# Using this information, together with the course page linked above, 
# fill in the missing part of the following code so we can convert an array of integers to base 8 (octal numbers). 
# Use the comments for help in determining where to make your modifications, 
# and make sure to review the "Approach/Algorithm" section for this exercise; it should prove useful.

def convert_to_base_8(n)

# The correct type of argument must be used below

# We'll need a Proc object to make this code work. Replace `a_proc`
# with the correct object
p [8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 33].map(&base8_proc) == [10, 12, 14, 16, 20, 41]
